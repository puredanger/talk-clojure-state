# README

This is a Clojure presentation and sample code. Included are the slides and the code.

The code is somewhat fragmented and may not actually work for you. It also has some weird
ns and use definitions due to some weirdnesses of running and testing in Light Table. Code
is provided as is - take it from what you will be recognize that it was written in the 
service of the talk.

Many thanks to Philly ETE for hosting this talk in April 2013.
